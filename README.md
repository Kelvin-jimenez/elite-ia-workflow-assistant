# Elite IA Workflow Assistant

Elite IA Workflow Assistant is a project focused on automating client request management using AI, workflows and business process automation.

## Objective

The goal is to build a system that can receive client requests, classify them with AI, store the information and generate an initial response proposal.

## Problem

Many small businesses manage client requests manually through WhatsApp, email, marketplaces and spreadsheets. This creates disorder, delays and repetitive work.

This project aims to reduce that manual work by creating a simple AI-powered workflow system.

## MVP

The first version will:

- Receive client requests through a form
- Store the information in Google Sheets
- Notify the responsible person
- Classify the request using AI
- Generate a suggested response
- Keep human approval before sending anything

## Tech Stack

- n8n
- Google Forms or Tally
- Google Sheets
- AI / LLM APIs
- GitHub
- Markdown

## Project Status

In progress.
